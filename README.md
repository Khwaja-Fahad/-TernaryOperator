# TernaryOperator

The TernaryOperatorExample repository contains a C program that demonstrates the use of the ternary conditional operator (? :). This operator provides a concise way to write a simple if-else statement in a single line. The program initializes a variable x with a value of 25 and uses the ternary operator to assign the value of 6 to variable y if x is greater than or equal to 6; otherwise, it assigns the value of x to y. The final value of y is then printed.
